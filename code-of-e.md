**Code of E for the _____ Project**  

1. The creators and core team of the _____ project are the ultimate overlords. Their decisions are final, whether technical or otherwise. Yes, even that one.  

2. Contributions arenâ€™t optionalâ€”theyâ€™re the cover charge for being here. Donâ€™t expect to show up, eat the free snacks, and leave your work for someone else forever.  

3. Challenges within the project are fair game for everyone. If you want to tackle the gnarly stuff, go for itâ€”just donâ€™t cry if it bites back.  

4. Authority here isnâ€™t inherited, bought, or handed out like candy. Itâ€™s earned through blood (metaphorically), sweat (literally), and contribution (absolutely).  

5. In the software jungle, the strongest survive. Superior code eats inferior code for breakfast, and weâ€™re all here for the buffet.  

6. This is a haven for technical brilliance, not your soapbox. If itâ€™s not about the project, save it for your blog.  

7. Non-technical drama? Take it outside. Disrupt the project, and youâ€™ll find yourself on the fast track to irrelevance.  

8. Your body, beliefs, and preferences are irrelevant hereâ€”your code, ideas, and contributions are what count. Unless your code tries to redefine pi, then we might have a problem.  

9. Argue the idea, not the person. Unless the idea is terrible, in which case, argue politely.  

10. Thinking trumps feelings. If your code breaks because you *felt* it would work, prepare for a bug reportâ€”and possibly a meme in your honor.  

11. Ambiguity is like an unsquashed bug: weâ€™ll ask about it, then ask again. If it persists, weâ€™ll quietly ignore it and hope it doesnâ€™t cause production outages.  

12. Illegal outside the project? Illegal here too. This Code of Merit isnâ€™t above the lawâ€”weâ€™d prefer to avoid courtrooms, thank you.  

13. This Code only applies to the project itself. What you do on your time is your business (but if itâ€™s cool, we want to hear about it).  

14. By participating, youâ€™re agreeing to this Code of Merit. If you didnâ€™t read it all the way through, well, thatâ€™s on you.  

15. The projectâ€™s purpose is sacred. Deviate from it, and youâ€™ll face the swift justice of remedial actionâ€”possibly accompanied by a sternly worded GIF.

16.  We take our work seriously, but weâ€™re far from stuffy or boringâ€”we know how to have fun while creating and innovating.
